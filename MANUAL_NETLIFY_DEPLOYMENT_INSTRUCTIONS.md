# Manual Netlify Deployment Instructions for TK999

## Deployment Files Ready

Your application has been successfully built and the deployment files are ready in the `tk999-netlify-deploy` directory.

## Manual Deployment Steps

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Visit https://app.netlify.com/
   - Sign in to your Netlify account

2. **Create a New Site**
   - Click on "Add new site" button
   - Select "Deploy manually" or "Import an existing project"

3. **Upload Deployment Files**
   - Drag and drop the entire `tk999-netlify-deploy` directory contents
   - Or zip the contents of `tk999-netlify-deploy` and upload the zip file

4. **Configure Build Settings (if needed)**
   - Since you're uploading pre-built files, no build command is needed
   - Publish directory: (leave as default or set to root)

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait for deployment to complete

## Current Application Status

The current deployment includes:
- The homepage with full betting application UI
- All necessary assets (CSS, JS, images)
- Test pages

Note: This is a simplified version that shows the homepage. We can add more features like login, dashboard, etc. in subsequent deployments once we resolve the technical issues.

## Future Enhancements

To add the full application with login, dashboard, and other features:
1. We need to resolve the TypeScript type issues in the App.tsx file
2. Rebuild the application with full routing
3. Redeploy the updated build

Would you like me to help you work on resolving the TypeScript issues next?
