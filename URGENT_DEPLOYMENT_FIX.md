# URGENT: TK999 Deployment Fix Required

## Current Status
- **Deployment URL**: https://tk999-betting-app.netlify.app/
- **Issue**: Showing "Beautiful Solid Cards" demo page instead of actual TK999 betting application
- **Root Cause**: Old deployment with static HTML demo files instead of React application

## Immediate Action Required
You need to redeploy the correct files to fix this issue:

### Option 1: Manual Redeployment (Fastest)
1. Visit https://app.netlify.com/
2. Go to your tk999-betting-app site
3. Drag and drop the `tk999-netlify-deploy` folder from this directory
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Upload Correct ZIP File
1. Visit https://app.netlify.com/
2. Go to your tk999-betting-app site
3. Upload the `tk999-netlify-deployment-final.zip` file
4. Wait for deployment to complete

## Files to Deploy
The correct deployment files are in:
- Directory: `tk999-netlify-deploy`
- ZIP File: `tk999-netlify-deployment-final.zip`

These files contain:
- Proper React application with `<div id="root">`
- Compiled JavaScript and CSS assets
- All betting platform functionality

## Verification After Deployment
After redeploying, visit https://tk999-betting-app.netlify.app/ and you should see:
- Login page at /login
- Dashboard at /dashboard (after login)
- Betting interface at /matches (after login)
- All other application routes working

## Test Accounts
Use these credentials after deployment:
- **Admin**: admin@example.com / admin123
- **Staff**: staff@example.com / staff123
- **Regular User**: Any email/password (creates account automatically)

## Important
The current deployment is NOT showing the actual TK999 betting application. This needs to be fixed by redeploying the correct files.
