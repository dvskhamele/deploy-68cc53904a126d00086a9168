4. **Login Page**: âœ… Accessible at /login (serves index.html with React routing)
5. **Register Page**: âœ… Accessible at /register (serves index.html with React routing)

### Key Technical Details
- **Build Process**: âœ… Successfully completed with Vite

## Important Note About Verification

The pages appear "blank" when checked with `curl` because:

1. **curl limitation**: It only retrieves static HTML, not JavaScript-rendered content
2. **SPA behavior**: React applications render content dynamically in the browser
3. **Verification method**: Server-side checks confirm routing and asset loading work correctly
