# How to Check Netlify Deployment Errors

## Accessing the Netlify Dashboard

1. Open your web browser and go to [https://app.netlify.com/](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Sign in to your Netlify account using your credentials
3. After logging in, you'll see your Netlify dashboard with a list of your sites

## Navigating to Your Site

1. Find "tk999-betting-app" in your list of sites
2. Click on the site name to go to the site dashboard

## Navigating to Deployment Logs

1. In the site dashboard, click on "Deploys" in the left sidebar
2. You'll see a list of deployments with their status (green for success, red for error)
3. Find the most recent deployment with a red "Error" status
4. Click on that deployment row to expand the deployment details

## Identifying Specific Error Messages

Look for:
- Error Summary at the top of deployment details
- Lines in the build log marked with "Error:", "Failed:", or red text
- Common issues like build script failures, missing dependencies, or configuration errors

## Based on Our Analysis

From reviewing the deployment files, we know:
- The latest deployment is showing as "error" in the Netlify API
- The site is still showing the static demo page instead of the React application
- There may be issues with build settings or configuration files

## Common Issues to Look For

1. **Build Settings**: Check if Netlify is trying to build the site instead of just deploying the static files
2. **Configuration**: Verify that the build directory is correctly set
3. **File Structure**: Ensure all necessary files are in the correct locations

## Next Steps

1. Follow the detailed instructions above to identify the specific error messages
2. Once identified, you can determine if it's a configuration issue, build issue, or file structure problem
3. If automated deployment continues to fail, consider using the manual deployment option with the `tk999-netlify-deploy` directory

## Manual Deployment Alternative

If you continue to have issues with automated deployment:

1. In the Netlify dashboard, go to your site settings
2. Click on "Deploy settings"
3. Choose "Drag and drop" deployment method
4. Drag the entire `tk999-netlify-deploy` directory onto the deployment area
5. Wait for the deployment to complete
