# Netlify Build Limit Issue Resolution for TK999

## Issue
You're seeing the message: "All builds will be paused to prevent overages, but all projects remain online unless other limits are reached. Your builds will resume next month or you may upgrade your team for more build minutes."

This is a common situation with Netlify's free tier where you've reached the monthly build minutes limit.

## Why This Happens
Netlify's free tier includes a limited number of build minutes per month. When you exceed this limit:
- Existing sites remain online
- New builds are paused until the next billing cycle
- This is a standard practice to prevent overages

## The Good News
The TK999 frontend is already pre-built with:
- All CSS embedded directly in HTML files
- No external dependencies
- No build step required for deployment

This means you can deploy without using any Netlify build minutes!

## Solutions

### 1. Manual Drag & Drop Deployment (Immediate)
1. Visit [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Simply drag and drop the `tk999-netlify-deploy` folder onto the deployment area
3. Your site will be live within seconds!

### 2. GitHub Integration (Recommended for ongoing development)
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Push the contents of `tk999-netlify-deploy` to this repository
