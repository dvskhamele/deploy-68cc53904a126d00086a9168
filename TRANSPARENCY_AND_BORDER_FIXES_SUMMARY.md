# Transparency and Border Style Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified
The application was experiencing transparency issues after deployment where elements appeared transparent or weren't displaying properly. This was caused by:
1. Gradient backgrounds that didn't render correctly in the deployed environment
2. Transparent elements that caused visual issues
3. Border styles that needed to be made more consistent and solid

## Fixes Applied

### 5. Updated index.css
- Updated `body::before` pseudo-element to use `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)` instead of `transparent`

## Verification
All components now use solid backgrounds and borders instead of gradients or transparent elements, which should resolve the transparency issues observed after deployment.
