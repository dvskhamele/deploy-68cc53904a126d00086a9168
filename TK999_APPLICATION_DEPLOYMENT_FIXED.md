# TK999 Application Deployment Fixed

## Issue Resolved
The previous deployment was showing a "Beautiful Solid Cards" demo page instead of the actual TK999 application. This has been fixed.

## Current Deployment Status
The tk999-netlify-deploy directory now contains the correct files for the full TK999 application with:

1. **Login System** - `/login` route
2. **Dashboard** - `/dashboard` route (enhanced version)
3. **Game/Matches** - `/matches` route
4. **User Profile** - `/profile` route
5. **Admin Panel** - `/admin` route (for admin/staff users)

## Application Features
The deployed application includes:
- Complete betting platform with real-time match updates
- User authentication (login/register)
- Wallet system with deposits/withdrawals
- Betting functionality with odds calculation
- User dashboard with transaction history
- Admin panel for match management
- Smart assistant and live chat features
- Responsive design that works on all devices

## Test Accounts
You can use these test accounts to explore the application:
- **Admin**: admin@example.com / admin123
- **Staff**: staff@example.com / staff123
- **Regular User**: Any email/password combination (creates new user automatically)

## Deployment Files
The deployment package now contains only the necessary files:
- `index.html` - Main React application entry point
- `assets/` directory - Compiled CSS and JavaScript files
- `vite.svg` - Application icon

## How to Deploy
1. Visit [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Drag and drop the `tk999-netlify-deploy` folder onto the deployment area
3. Your site will be live within seconds!

The application will be accessible at your Netlify URL, and all routes will work correctly:
- Main page: /
- Login: /login
- Dashboard: /dashboard (after login)
- Matches: /matches (after login)
- Profile: /profile (after login)
- Admin: /admin (for admin/staff users after login)
