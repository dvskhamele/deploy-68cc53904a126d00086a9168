# CSS/Styling Fix for TK999 Deployment

## Issue
The deployed version of the TK999 application was missing CSS styling, resulting in an unstyled interface. Investigation revealed that the CSS file in the deployment was empty.

## Root Cause
The `index.css` file in the frontend source was empty and missing the required Tailwind CSS directives:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Without these directives, Tailwind CSS couldn't generate the necessary styles during the build process, resulting in an empty CSS output file.

## Solution
1. Added the Tailwind CSS directives to `/frontend/src/index.css`
2. Rebuilt the frontend application with `npm run build`
3. Copied the updated `dist` folder to the deployment directory
4. Verified that the CSS file now contains the proper styling (9.16 kB)

## Prevention
Updated the build script (`build.sh`) to automatically ensure the Tailwind directives are present in `index.css` before each build to prevent this issue in the future.

## Verification
After applying the fix, the deployed application now has proper styling and visual appearance.
