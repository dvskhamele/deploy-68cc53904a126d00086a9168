# TK999 Deployment Fixed - Automated Git Push Deployment

## Issue Resolved
The Netlify deployment at https://tk999-betting-app.netlify.app/ was showing a "Beautiful Solid Cards" demo page instead of the actual TK999 betting application.

## Root Cause
The `client/dist` directory contained static HTML demo files instead of the compiled React application.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Built the correct React application** from `tk999-deployment/frontend`
2. **Replaced the demo files** in `client/dist` with the actual compiled React app
3. **Force-committed the dist files** to Git (bypassing .gitignore)
4. **Pushed changes to GitHub** to trigger automatic Netlify deployment

## Changes Made
- Replaced `client/dist/index.html` (demo page → React app entry point)
- Added proper JavaScript and CSS assets in `client/dist/assets/`
- Updated 7 files in total

## Deployment Status
✅ **Deployment triggered** - Changes pushed to GitHub repository
✅ **Automatic deployment** - Netlify will deploy from GitHub automatically
✅ **No manual intervention required** - Deployment happens automatically

## Expected Result
After Netlify finishes deploying, https://tk999-betting-app.netlify.app/ will show:
- Login page at /login
- Dashboard at /dashboard (after login)
- Betting interface at /matches (after login)
- User profile at /profile (after login)
- Admin panel at /admin (for admin/staff users)

## Test Accounts
Use these credentials after deployment:
- **Admin**: admin@example.com / admin123
- **Staff**: staff@example.com / staff123
- **Regular User**: Any email/password (creates account automatically)
