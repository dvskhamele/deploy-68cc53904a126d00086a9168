# TK999 Frontend localStorage Implementation Summary

## Overview
The TK999 frontend application has been successfully configured to use localStorage for full end-to-end persistence across all pages. This ensures that user data, authentication state, and application data persist across browser sessions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Authentication Persistence
- **User Data**: Stored in `localStorage.user` as JSON
- **Authentication Token**: Stored in `localStorage.token`
- **Persistence**: Data survives page refreshes and browser restarts

### 2. Application Data Storage
- **Core Data**: All application data is stored in `localStorage.appData`
- **Data Structure**:
  - Users (with wallet balances and bet history)
  - Matches (organized by categories)
  - Bets (bet history for all users)
  - Transactions (deposit/withdrawal history)

### 3. Key Features
- **Automatic Data Loading**: App loads existing data from localStorage on startup
- **Real-time Updates**: All data modifications are immediately saved to localStorage
- **Default Data**: Falls back to mock data if no localStorage data exists
- **Cross-Page Consistency**: All pages (Home, Login, Register, Dashboard, Matches, Admin) share the same data source

### 4. Pages Verified
- ✅ Home Page
- ✅ Login Page
- ✅ Register Page
- ✅ Dashboard Page (Profile, Wallet, Transactions)
- ✅ Matches Page (Betting functionality)
- ✅ Admin Page (Match management, User management, Bet tracking)

### 5. Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ User registration and automatic login
- ✅ User login with token persistence
- ✅ User logout with complete data cleanup
- ✅ Wallet balance updates across sessions
- ✅ Bet placement and history tracking
- ✅ Match result updates (Admin functionality)

## Testing Results
All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ localStorage functionality verification
- ✅ User authentication persistence
- ✅ Data persistence across sessions
- ✅ Logout/login scenarios
- ✅ Cross-page data consistency

## How to Test
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open your browser to http://localhost:5173
3. Register a new user or login with:
   - Regular user: any email with OTP `123456`
   - Admin user: email `admin@example.com` with OTP `admin123`
4. Perform actions (place bets, deposit/withdraw funds)
5. Refresh the page or close and reopen the browser
6. Verify that all data persists correctly

## Technical Notes
- Uses a mock API implementation that reads from and writes to localStorage
- No external dependencies required for data persistence
- All data is stored locally in the browser
- No server-side storage is implemented in this prototype
