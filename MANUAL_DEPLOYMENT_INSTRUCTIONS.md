# Manual Deployment Instructions for TK999 to Netlify


Since the Netlify CLI is experiencing permission issues, follow these manual steps to deploy your TK999 application:

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure the `tk999-netlify-deploy` directory contains the built application files:
   - `index.html` (with `<div id="root"></div>`)
   - `assets` folder with compiled JavaScript and CSS files
   - Other supporting files (images, icons, etc.)

2. Verify directory contents:
   ```bash
   ls -la /Users/test/startups/TK999/tk999-netlify-deploy/
   ```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Access Netlify Dashboard

1. Open your browser and go to https://app.netlify.com/
2. Log in to your Netlify account (or create one if you don't have it)

### 2. Navigate to Your Site

1. If you already have the `tk999-betting-app` site:
   - Click on the site from your dashboard
   - Go to "Site settings" > "Build & deploy" > "Deployments"
   - Click "Trigger deploy" > "Deploy site"

2. If you need to create a new deployment:
   - From the main dashboard, click "Add new site" > "Deploy manually"

### 3. Upload Files

1. Locate the `tk999-netlify-deploy` directory on your computer:
   ```
   /Users/test/startups/TK999/tk999-netlify-deploy/
   ```

2. Drag and drop the entire `tk999-netlify-deploy` folder onto the Netlify deployment area

3. Wait for the upload to complete (this may take a few minutes depending on your connection)

### 4. Wait for Deployment

1. Netlify will automatically start deploying your site after the upload completes
2. You'll see the deployment status change from "Uploading" to "Processing" to "Published"
3. The deployment URL will be displayed when complete

### 5. Verify Deployment

1. Visit your deployed site: https://tk999-betting-app.netlify.app/
2. Check that:
   - The page shows the TK999 betting application (not the "Beautiful Solid Cards" demo)
   - You can navigate to different sections (login, dashboard, etc.)
   - All styling and functionality works correctly

### 6. Customize Site Name (Optional)

1. In your site's dashboard, go to "Site settings" > "Change site name"
2. Enter a custom name if desired
3. Click "Save"

## Directory Structure Confirmation

Before deploying, ensure your `tk999-netlify-deploy` directory has this structure:

```
tk999-netlify-deploy/
├── assets/
│   ├── index-CLH_FBkY.js
│   ├── index-CmJebkS1.css
│   └── vendor-nf7bT_Uh.js
├── index.html
├── vite.svg
└── (other supporting files)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Site still shows demo page**:
   - Ensure you're uploading the correct directory
   - Check that `index.html` contains `<div id="root"></div>` (not demo content)
   - Clear your browser cache

2. **Deployment fails**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try again after a few minutes
   - Ensure all files in the directory have read permissions

3. **Application doesn't work correctly**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify all assets loaded correctly
   - Confirm there are no broken links

## Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. Test all application features
2. Share the URL with team members for review
3. Set up any custom domain if needed
4. Monitor the site for any issues

Your TK999 betting application should now be live at https://tk999-betting-app.netlify.app/
