# TK999 Deployment Issue Summary

## Current Status
The TK999 betting application deployment to Netlify is incomplete. The site at https://tk999-betting-app.netlify.app/ is still showing the "Beautiful Solid Cards" demo page instead of the actual application.

## Issues Encountered
1. **Netlify CLI Permission Problems**: Attempts to use the Netlify CLI for deployment failed due to permission issues with the Netlify configuration files.
2. **Manual Deployment Not Completed**: The manual deployment process hasn't been completed yet.

## What We've Verified
1. The local deployment directory (`tk999-netlify-deploy`) contains all the correct files for the TK999 betting application.
2. The `index.html` file properly references the React application with `<div id="root"></div>`.
3. All necessary JavaScript and CSS assets are present in the `assets` directory.

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Manual Deployment**: 
   - Open https://app.netlify.com/
   - Navigate to the tk999-betting-app site
   - Drag and drop the `tk999-netlify-deploy` directory for deployment
   - Wait for deployment to complete

2. **Alternative Permission Fix** (if CLI is preferred):
   - Contact system administrator to resolve sudo permissions
   - Or manually change ownership of Netlify config directories

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - After deployment, check that https://tk999-betting-app.netlify.app/ shows the actual TK999 application
   - Test login and navigation features

The local files are ready for deployment, but require either manual upload through the Netlify dashboard or resolution of the CLI permission issues.
