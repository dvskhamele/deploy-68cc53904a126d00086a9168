# TK999 Deployment Solutions

## Netlify Build Limit Issue
Your Netlify builds are currently paused due to reaching the free tier limits. This is a common situation and there are several ways to resolve it.

## Deployment Options

### 1. Manual Drag & Drop (Fastest)
1. Visit [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Simply drag and drop the `tk999-netlify-deploy` folder onto the deployment area
3. Your site will be live within seconds!

### 2. GitHub Integration (Recommended for ongoing development)
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Push the contents of `tk999-netlify-deploy` to this repository
3. In Netlify, import the project from GitHub
4. Set publish directory to `/` (no build command needed)

### 3. Alternative Hosting
Consider these alternatives that don't have build limits:
- **Vercel** - Excellent free tier
- **GitHub Pages** - Completely free
- **Firebase Hosting** - Generous free tier

## Why This Works
The TK999 frontend is already pre-built with:
- All CSS embedded directly in HTML files
- No external dependencies
- No build step required

This means you can deploy directly without using Netlify's build minutes.

## Next Steps
Run the detailed deployment script for step-by-step instructions:
```bash
./netlify-deployment-with-limit-workaround.sh
```
