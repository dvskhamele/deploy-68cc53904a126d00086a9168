# TK999 Netlify Deployment Summary

## Project Status

✅ GitHub repository already initialized
✅ Netlify deployment script created
✅ Netlify configuration documented
✅ README.md updated with deployment instructions

## Deployment Instructions

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have Netlify CLI installed:
   ```
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Login to your Netlify account:
   ```
   netlify login
   ```

3. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   ./deploy-to-netlify.sh
   ```

The script will:
- Extract the frontend files from `tk999-frontend.zip`
- Deploy them to Netlify
- Prompt you to either create a new site or link to an existing one
- Provide you with a live URL for your site

### Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. Extract the frontend files:
   ```
   unzip tk999-frontend.zip
   ```

2. Deploy using Netlify CLI:
   ```
   netlify deploy --dir=frontend/dist --prod
   ```

## Files Created

1. `deploy-to-netlify.sh` - Automated deployment script
2. `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Detailed deployment instructions
3. Updated `README.md` with deployment instructions

## Configuration

The project includes a `netlify.toml` file in the client directory with the following configuration:
```toml
[build]
  base = "client/"
  publish = "dist/"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

This configuration:
- Sets the base directory to `client/`
- Publishes files from the `dist/` directory
- Uses `npm run build` to build the project
- Sets up SPA routing with a redirect rule

## Next Steps

1. Run the deployment script or follow manual deployment instructions
2. After deployment, configure a custom domain in the Netlify dashboard if needed
3. Share the live URL with stakeholders for review

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure Netlify CLI is properly installed and you're logged in
2. Check that the `tk999-frontend.zip` file exists in the project directory
3. Verify that the extracted frontend files are valid by running them locally
4. Refer to `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps
