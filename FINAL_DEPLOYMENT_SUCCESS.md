# 🎉 TK999 BETTING APP DEPLOYMENT - SUCCESSFULLY FIXED!

## 🔧 ISSUE RESOLVED

The TK999 betting application was experiencing a **blank white page** issue on Netlify deployment due to incorrect deployment configuration. The React application was building correctly but the deployment was pointing to the wrong directory.

## 🛠️ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Root Cause
The deployment directory contained standalone HTML test files instead of the compiled React application build output.

### Fix Applied
1. **Corrected Deployment Source**: Updated deployment to use `client/dist` (the proper React build output) instead of test files
2. **Preserved React Routing**: Maintained all React components, routing, and functionality
3. **Verified Asset Loading**: Confirmed JavaScript bundles and CSS assets are properly referenced and loading

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS
