# TK999 Deployment Analysis

## Current Status
The latest push to the repository should have triggered an automatic deployment to Netlify, but the site is still showing the static demo page instead of the React application.

## Findings
1. The git push was successful (commit 3ac4e1b: "Update deployment with correct React app build")
2. The Netlify API shows the latest deployment status as "error"
3. The site configuration has redirects that should route all requests to index.html
4. There is no netlify.toml in the root directory, but there is one in the client directory

## Issues
1. The deployment is failing, which is why the site is still showing the old content
2. The Netlify configuration might not be correctly set up to build and deploy from the right directory

## Next Steps
1. Check the Netlify dashboard for specific error messages
2. Verify that the build settings in Netlify are pointing to the correct directory
3. Check if there are any environment variables needed for the build
4. Consider redeploying manually through the Netlify dashboard
